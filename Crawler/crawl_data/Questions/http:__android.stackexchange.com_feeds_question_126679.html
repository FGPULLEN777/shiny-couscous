The worst part about this is that I&#39;m pretty confident I know how to fix it, but I don&#39;t know how to go about doing the thing  I need to do to fix it. Bear with me a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I have a stock Droid Turbo, I don&#39;t have any kind of ROMS or any non-play store stuff on it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what I did was I went into developer settings on the phone, the &quot;Hidden Settings&quot; and I started fiddling with stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I either pressed on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simulate secondary displaysor Force RTL layout direction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and the phone&#39;s GUI crashed hard. Now it&#39;s completely bonkers, and only endlessly loops the error that &quot;Unfortunately, the System UI has stopped working.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now my question is, is there a way to reset those options in the developer menu somehow, without doing a factory reset? I have a few apps that store local data that will get erased, and I&#39;d rather not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the phone is still working in the background, I can hear text message notifications and it rings when I get a call, though I can&#39;t interact with it in any way. The Droid Turbo user interface (For gestures while the phone is locked) works too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried clearing the cache, I tried letting it complexly run out of battery and doing it again. Hard resets. Nothing seems to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst part is that my PC Doesn&#39;t want to recognize it either, which is odd. While in the bootloader it got a connection to my PC as a linux USB Storage device, inside system recovery it made the noise like something is there, but it&#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So any tips? any way to save my data before I have to factory reset this? I really can&#39;t lose that data, a few apps I have store user data locally.&lt;/p&gt;        </summary>    </entry></feed>
