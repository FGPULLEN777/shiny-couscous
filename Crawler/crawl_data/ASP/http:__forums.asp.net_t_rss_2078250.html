I have used the same&lt;br&gt;hosting company for nearly ten years and I never had any problem making web sites this way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I cannot get my sites to go onto the server and there appears to be technical incompatibility between VS 2015&lt;br&gt;and how the Server people have set up their system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To make things simple I took a tempate from VS 2015 : New Project &amp;gt; Visual Basic &amp;gt; ASP.NET Web Application &amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;Web Forms Template. This is just the &amp;quot;ASP.NET is a free....&amp;quot; template everyone has seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I added &amp;lt;customErrors mode=&amp;quot;Off&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; Just to be sure there were no bugs I went Project &amp;gt; Build. This was OK. Then I went&lt;br&gt;Project &amp;gt; Publish and took the FTP option. This was also OK except that I got an error message&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The application attempted to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy.&amp;nbsp; To grant this&lt;br&gt;application the required permission please contact your system administrator or change the application's&lt;br&gt;trust level in the configuration file.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I altered the trust level in the web.config file to Medium according to the instructions in an MSDN document,&lt;br&gt;but then I got another error message.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This configuration section cannot be used at this path.&amp;nbsp; This happens when the site administrator has&lt;br&gt;locked access to this section using &amp;lt;location allowOverride=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;&amp;gt; from an inherited configuration file.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I referred to the server support team and they said :&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;What you're doing locally is fine, the web.config is correct and sets the app to be developed in medium trust,&lt;br&gt;unfortunately our servers prohibit the changing of this setting and rather than gracefully ignore ASP.net&lt;br&gt;throws a fatal error about it. The simplest solution to this is to edit your local IIS, or development settings&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;to run this in medium trust without having to have the lines in your web.config, otherwise every time you&lt;br&gt;upload it you will need to remove the lines about medium trust. Do you test this locally be deploying to an IIS&lt;br&gt;instance?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We do have a few other customers running VS2015 and they've not mentioned this as an issue, I can only&lt;br&gt;assume they've done one of the above things as if I look at their web.config files they don't have the&lt;br&gt;lines setting the trust level at all.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I'm in limbo. The server team is seemingly at odds with Microsoft. I don't understand what :&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The simplest solution to this is to edit your local IIS, or development settings&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;to run this in medium trust without having to have the lines in your web.config&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;involves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please could someone tell me what to do ?&lt;/p&gt;</description><a10:updated>2015-11-22T12:30:15-08:00</a10:updated></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">5992850</guid><link>http://forums.asp.net/p/2078250/5992850.aspx?Re+Publishing+to+a+web+site</link><title>Re: Publishing to a web site</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From your description above, something happens during upgrade from VS2008 to VS 2015. Here are some steps to configure your application to run on .NET Framework 4.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.Create a text file that has the same name as your application, and add the file extension .config. For example, if your application is named contoso.exe, your application configuration file must be named contoso.exe.config.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.Add the &amp;lt;supportedRuntime&amp;gt; element as follows to the application configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="prettyprint "&gt;&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;startup&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;supportedRuntime version=&amp;quot;version&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/startup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information: &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj152935(v=vs.110).aspx"&gt;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj152935(v=vs.110).aspx&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope it helps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angie&lt;/p&gt;</description><a10:updated>2015-11-23T07:57:06-08:00</a10:updated></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">5993044</guid><link>http://forums.asp.net/p/2078250/5993044.aspx?Re+Publishing+to+a+web+site</link><title>Re: Publishing to a web site</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Angie,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried it out and fiddled with it for a while but I could not make it work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server team and I have been struggling with VS 2015 for nearly two weeks now and I have decided to abandon Visual Studio altogether. What was, in 2008, a marvellously simple and effective system has been screwed up into an unworkable bodge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The matter has been made worse by Windows 10 which contains unforgivable errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Morley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><a10:updated>2015-11-23T17:21:07-08:00</a10:updated></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">5998620</guid><link>http://forums.asp.net/p/2078250/5998620.aspx?Re+Publishing+to+a+web+site</link><title>Re: Publishing to a web site</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span class="icon-blockquote"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h4&gt;dcwmorley&lt;/h4&gt;The server team and I have been struggling with VS 2015 for nearly two weeks now and I have decided to abandon Visual Studio altogether.

If you do not use Visual Studio to perform the upgrade automatically, you must manually edit the Web.config file and must manually associate the application in IIS with the&amp;nbsp;.NET Framework version&amp;nbsp;4.&amp;nbsp; More information: &lt;a title="Upgrade an ASP.NET Web Application to ASP.NET 4" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd483478(v=vs.100).aspx"&gt;Upgrade an ASP.NET Web Application to ASP.NET 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you need any help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><a10:updated>2015-12-09T05:22:12-08:00</a10:updated></item></channel></rss>
