I started having some lagging with my streaming services Icecast/MPD and MiniDLNA.  I assumed I just needed to reboot and then was not able to even get into the computer.  Being one who does not regularly make backups, that was the first thing I tried to do so now I have a separate drive that has my &quot;old&quot; system on it (used ddrescue from live USB).  From the login, I would try to log in to GNOME Classic and nothing would happen, it would just change screens and hang.  I decided with a backup in hand I would simply upgrade to 14.04 LTS and everything would work itself out.  Not so.  I can get into GNOME but after a short period of time the desktop manager freezes and locks they keyboard out.  I think the mouse still moves and I know the system is still working since I can still hear the music, SFTP in, access MPD, MiniDLNA, etc.  I have tried to get into a shell with CTRL ALT F7 but nothing happens, the Caps Lock key doesn't work, the only thing I can do is CTRL ALT PrtSCN and the REISUB to reboot the computer (other than the case reset key).  I installed xubuntu desktop and am presently able to do *most* things with that though generally Google Chrome locks that up too in short order.  I don't particularly want to change and cannot stand how it suspends music playback when I lock the screen.  I think there is a workaround for that but the biggest problem is with GNOME.<br /><br />In addition to doing the release upgrade, and installing xubuntu, I've tried to get rid of all traces of GNOME and then reinstall.  GNOME still locks up within a couple minutes of booting into it.  I really do not want to have to rebuild the system from scratch since it has been a while since I got everything working on the back end, etc.  The system I'm on now is the 14.04 LTS/Xubuntu.  I had planned on upgrading at some point anyway so that is fine, but I would like to be able to use The classic gnome as well as to be able to use chrome.<br /><br />I've been running Ubuntu for a while now but am generally limited to knowing enough to get by.  The things I've set up on the &quot;server&quot; side of the system are working the way I want and I'm really hoping I don't have to try and recreate that from scratch (users, services, permissions, etc.)  I don't like xubuntu and just want to figure out what is wrong with GNOME and get back to where I was two weeks ago. <br /><br />Help is appreciated.</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=329">Desktop Environments</category>			<dc:creator>bvargo</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305523</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title><![CDATA[[kubuntu] Tooltip color]]></title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305514&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2015 20:08:38 GMT</pubDate>			<description>I recently installed Kubuntu 15.10 and I notice that in GNUCash and GIMP the tooltip text is displayed as white on something almost white.
