I did an upgrade to low latency kernel 3.16.0.55.46 and all heck broke loose. The system would randomly freeze... sometimes the keyboard would stop working, then the mouse and finally the window environment would freeze. I thought it might be a video card issue so I removed the 750ti and ran on the onboard video card. Seemed to be more stable but then while I was away from the screen, the system fell back to a frozen console with errors and such and the one message that caught my eye was something about the cpu's being out of sync. <br /><br />I immediately thought it might be a kernel issue. Funny thing is I never had a kernel upgrade go bad since I've been using Linux since 1995. The system remained stable enough after a reboot to allow me to reinstall low latency kernel 3.16.0.52 (I removed the older kernel after the installation of the new one). The system has been running fine ever since. <br /><br />Anyone else have similar issues? If someone can point me to the log file that had the console errors it would be appreciated. I looked in var/log/ but so far haven't found it.</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=335">Ubuntu Studio</category>			<dc:creator>rlovi</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305494</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title><![CDATA[[ubuntu_studio] Install Ubuntu Studio on an external drive for Mac]]></title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305460&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2015 13:26:52 GMT</pubDate>			<description><![CDATA[I'd like to install Ubuntu Studio on an external drive for use with a Macbook Air, for my daughter.

I don't know that I would necessarily need dual boot, since I was thinking that I could show her how to change the startup drive when she wants to use Studio.

At the end of the loop, another one begins to give another chance to my student to manage his riff. <br /><br />At the end, I erase the bad loops and keep the good ones. <br /><br />I can paste all the loop to do a &quot;song&quot; . <br /><br />How can I do that simply and quickly with linux ??<br /><br />Thanks thanks !!<br /><br />Nico<br /><br /><br /> bonjour,<br /><br />Je reviens vers vous. Je suis prof de guitare et souhaite quitter windows.<br /><br />Actuellement je lance des loops de batterie et mes élèves s'enregistrent  par dessus à la guitare. J'ai juste à ouvrir mes logiciels ( riffwork  pour les loop et l'enregistrement et pod farm pour le son des guitares)<br /><br />A la fin de chaque loop, une autre se déclenche automatiquement pour  donner une chance supplémentaire à l'élève d'enregistrer son riff en  mieux.<br /><br />A la fin je supprime les riffs où mes élèves se sont vautrer.<br /><br />J'ai deux mesures avec métronome qui se lancent avant l'enregistrement.  Et ensuite les mesures défilent avec les temps à l'intérieur pour savoir  où l'on est .<br /><br />AU final, je peux coller mes loops sous forme de &quot;briques&quot; à l'intérieur d'un morceau.<br /><br />Que me proposez vous chez linux pour que je quitte enfin windows?<br /><br />J'espère que ce post sera assez précis pour que vous m'aidiez<br /><br />Un gros gros merci !</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=335">Ubuntu Studio</category>			<dc:creator>calixtus06</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2304938</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title>How to connect Behringer Xenix Q802 USB mixer via JACK?</title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2304682&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Sun, 29 Nov 2015 05:36:43 GMT</pubDate>			<description>Can anyone explain in terms a not very computer literate PR-agency person can understand (if it is possible to accomplish at all) how to connect a Behringer Xenix USB audio mixer to the JACK-compatible programs in Ubuntu Studio using QjackCtl?

I am running the latest version of Ubuntu Studio and my PC has an i7 processor and lots of RAM.<br />The roster of Ubuntu Studio supported hardware lists, among others, the functionally very similar Focusrite Scarlett 2i2. Compatibility seems to have something to do with a &quot;snd-usb-audio module.&quot; But that sort of thing is WAY over my pay grade.<br />If it's no go with the Behringer, I'll get a PO cut for the Scarlett. But I would prefer not to if the Behringer can be made to work. <br />I did try as hard as I could to figure out how to do this on my own. For example, I did manage to wade my way through the documentation to the point where I figured out what the &quot;card number&quot; for my mixer is and that it has a Texas Instruments DAC:<br />card 4: CODEC [USB Audio CODEC], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]<br />  Subdevices: 1/1<br />  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0<br />I checked and my user is indeed in the &quot;audio&quot; group. At one point, I attempted a brute force solution by methodically trying all combinations of inputs in QjackCtl's Preferences. No joy. Much of the advice I could find said to use a Sound wizard in Settings. I can find no such wizard in Settings Manager.<br />Here are some - to me - puzzling clues: When I start Audacity under Ubuntu Studio, just like when I run it under Windows, the choice of input from my Behringer mixer is offered in the box by the little mic icon  as well as, I might mention, in the box next to the little speaker icon, the output to my Topping USB Class D audio amplifier is offered as well (which amp powers my JPL passive monitor speakers). Audacity works perfectly, no problems. Ditto for Audacious. Right out of the box, when I play MP3s with Audacious, the sound comes out via my Topping amp's DAC. With JACK, I have been unable to convince route inputs from my mixer or to send sound to my USB Topping audio amplifier's DAC. Luckily, my amplifier has a front panel switch that shifts the input to the amp from the USB to a cable running to that little green socket on the back of my PC. So I can at least listen to the output of JACK-compatible programs with my JBLs instead of my cheesy powered computer speakers.<br />I suspect that Pulse Audio and ALSA are a factor in my difficulties but the more I read about them, the more confused I got.<br />It's not all bad news. Connecting my M-Audio MIDI controller was a snap! That worked exactly as advertised. Thanks!</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=335">Ubuntu Studio</category>			<dc:creator>charlessmall18</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2304682</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title>Stop Panning of Background When Zooming Into Screen</title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2304544&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2015 22:46:46 GMT</pubDate>			<description>Hi      When I press the ALT and spin the Mouse Scroll Wheel I can  Zoom in and out of the screen.

I managed to set up most programs to work well, however I'm getting a strange problem that I can not figure out.<br /><br />Multiple times a day, I'm hearing a very loud high-pitched hissing or clipping noise for maybe half a second. It sounds a bit like white noise or a heavily overdriven signal, but it's hard to make out to be honest, since it is so short. Still, this is very irritating, especially when using headphones, as it seems the sound will always be as loud as the signal can get through my interface.<br /><br />I have tried to increase buffer size and reveiwed my device settings, but I can not find a solution for this. The noise only seems to appear when there actually is some kind of signal, but regardless of the program or current activity (e.g. in the middle of playing a song while idling). There seems to be no correlation between the noise and interface drop-outs/Xruns, as I do not get any from 256 samples upwards and they will sound differently. I never experienced this issue in Windows, but I also got drop-outs with lower buffer sizes.<br /><br />My system details are the following:<br /><br />Ubuntu Studio 15.10<br />CPU: Intel Xeon E3-1231<br />RAM: 32 GB DDR3<br />Interface: M-Audio Fast Track MkII (Motherboard sound device disabled in BIOS)<br /><br />I have added screenshots of my current Cadence-settings, maybe this could help.<br /><br />Has anyone ever experienced something similar to this or knows what I could try for a solution or to analyse the problem further?<br /><br /><br />Best regards!</div>	<div style="padding:6px">					<fieldset class="fieldset">			<legend>Attached Images</legend>			<ul>			<li>	<img class="inlineimg" src="http://ubuntuforums.org/images/attach/png.gif" alt="File Type: png" />	<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=265692&amp;d=1448043077" target="_blank">cad01.png</a> (77.9 KB)</li><li>	<img class="inlineimg" src="http://ubuntuforums.org/images/attach/png.gif" alt="File Type: png" />	<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=265693&amp;d=1448043083" target="_blank">cad02.png</a> (68.6 KB)</li><li>	<img class="inlineimg" src="http://ubuntuforums.org/images/attach/png.gif" alt="File Type: png" />	<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=265694&amp;d=1448043090" target="_blank">cad03.png</a> (74.7 KB)</li>			</ul>			</fieldset>			</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=335">Ubuntu Studio</category>			<dc:creator>Megadoomer</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2303669</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title>Cant detect/ solve soundcard conflicts with JACK applications</title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2303640&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 14:33:54 GMT</pubDate>			<description><![CDATA[Dear community,  I just switched from Xubuntu to Ubuntu studio for I found that I use one maschine for recording only.

Now I encounter problems I can't handle so I'm grateful for every hint.<br /><br />Immediately after installation I had no sound output and input in the programms I used intuitively under Xubuntu (Rosegarden, Audacity, Musescore). Instead Audacity showed me like 40 different output and input devices to choose from (formerly 3 or so). I figured, that the only combination working is<br /><br />ALSA + output:default + input: pulse: Rear Mic:0 + Stereo<br /><br />Now I have at least sound-output and basic recording working. All the other programs including JACK-Control dont seem to offer a) this combination ob b) dont let me play sounds with any other thing I tried.<br /><br />Thank You for your time and any possible hints on how to move on from this,<br /><br /><br />Konstantin</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=335">Ubuntu Studio</category>			<dc:creator>konstantin11</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2303640</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title><![CDATA[[ubuntu_studio] Problem install Ubuntu Studio]]></title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2303161&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2015 22:09:19 GMT</pubDate>			<description><![CDATA[I am new to Ubuntu Studio, I'm migrating from Windows to Ubuntu Studio, but I have a problem when installing Ubuntu Studio 14.04.3.

At first i thought it could be the sound card but the weird thing is that it works in Audacity. I got a bented electronic keyboard plugged through jack to the mic socket of the usb card. In audacity i select the usb card as mic input and it records like a charm.<br />I've tried unninstaling Qjack and reinstalling it. Try force reloading Alsa. Uninstalled pulseaudio after reading that it could affect the process. I've been trying with different tweaks but with no sucess.<br />The setup in Qjack used to be hw:0,0 for the output device and hw:1,0 for the input. (don't know if that helps)<br />The currently version Ubuntu is 14.04.3 LTS <br /><br />If someone could help me with this it would be really nice.<br />Thanks in advance</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=335">Ubuntu Studio</category>			<dc:creator>serge17</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2302826</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title><![CDATA[[ubuntu_studio] Want to help making Ubuntu Studio a great OS for creative humans?]]></title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2302537&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2015 10:29:56 GMT</pubDate>			<description>Most of the work we do *does not require any special skills*, so more or less *anyone can contribute*!
