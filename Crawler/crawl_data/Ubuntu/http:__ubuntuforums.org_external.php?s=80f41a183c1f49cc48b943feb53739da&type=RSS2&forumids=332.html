But the last one of the issues has been the Trackpad, I cannot get it to work no matter what I do.<br /><br />I've tried all the forums I can find online, all to no avail. What I have found is that the OS is not seeing my Trackpad, I've tried reinstalling Symnaptics at the end it says that it cannot see the Trackpad and it may be a Kernel issue.<br /><br />Help! What should I do? I've tried different Live-USB for Ubuntu and Elementary OS, I've tried installing them, they all have the same issues, GRUB and Trackpad not working. Could this be a Kernel issue? How can I fix it.<br /><br />May be important: To be able to get the system to boot, I've had to change the BIOS to Legacy booting.<br /><br />I appreciate your responses in advance.</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=332">Hardware</category>			<dc:creator>Andres_Lopez_de_Fa</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305670</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title><![CDATA[[UbuntuGnome] Ubuntu 15.10 doesn't like my Behringer 502USB Mixer]]></title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305616&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 19:55:27 GMT</pubDate>			<description><![CDATA[Edit: It's a 302, not a 502  It records too fast and I've googled it and google doesn't always work for everybody.

Good thing, too, because it doesn't work from what I can see.<br />I wanted to see what would happen if it did get read, so I made it immutable:<br />chattr +i /etc/X11/xorg.conf<br />That wouldn't even boot, so I had to change it back in shell.<br />Other notable facts:<br />Glxinfo shows GTX950m with appropriate drivers in use.<br /><br />Before upgrading, I wiped the fs and did a clean install of 15.04 to see the baseline situation. Before the nvidia-355 drivers were installed, glxinfo showed Intel Haswell graphics were in use. The graphics situation seemed a bit choppy, but with no horizontal screen tearing at all. I did not try loading nouveau.<br />None of the configuration changes in nvidia-settings seem to stick. Some settings are supposedly saved to nvidia-settings-rc in my home folder, but these do not survive a reboot. It does not look like anything of consequence is being saved there. I've already explained the xorg.conf situation.<br />Finally, nvidia-settings can't ID the monitor. I'm not sure if this is the normal situation for a laptop. X Server Display Configuration shows X Screen 0 (No Scanout). The horizontal screen tearing persists when I connect an external monitor which nvidia-settings correctly IDs as a Samsung, so I doubt that's related.<br /><br />Anyway. I simply must get this screen-tearing problem fixed. This laptop + Ubuntu 15.10 promises to be an awesome setup, but the screen-tearing makes me want to smash things. I'd sincerely appreciate any help.</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=332">Hardware</category>			<dc:creator>HuaiDan</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305565</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title><![CDATA[[lubuntu] Need help with graphics card choice]]></title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305549&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 04:00:46 GMT</pubDate>			<description>Hi and thank you for reading.

The goal here is to improve gaming performance while adhering to a low energy usage policy. The limit on my graphics rail is about 75 watts for graphics. I am confused however by the white colored graphics rail and what it is for. Here is a pic of what I am talking about<b></b>:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.compeve.com/Products/Motherboards/HP_Elite_8200_SFF/HP_Elite_8200_SFF_Compeve_2.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.compeve.com/Products/Moth..._Compeve_2.jpg</a><br /><br />Also I am thinking of putting a usb 3.0 card in the pci x1 slot, but if there is something like intel turbo cache that can work I am open to the idea.. I have a fresco logic pci to usb 3.0 in the standard pci slot already. It may be that this motherboard supports crossfire? and that might be the white second pci x16 slot?<br /><br />I have in the past looked into getting a gtx 750 ti before (60 watts) but picked the 7750 instead (55 watts) so I am looking to see what the new options are. Possibly crossfire two 7750's? but i read somewhere that the white rail might be limited to 35 watts, but then i read that the black graphics rail was 25 watts but the 7750 I have ran for years now is 55 watts.<br /><br /><b>Ok so an update:</b> I moved my graphics card to the white graphics x16 slot and I am now typing from it, so it is a graphics slot and it is <b>not</b> limited to 25 or 30 watts.</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=332">Hardware</category>			<dc:creator>vanquishedangel</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305549</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title>Cheap videocard for MSI 970 AM3+ Motherboard</title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305528&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 00:38:08 GMT</pubDate>			<description>Hello, I am looking for a very cheap videocard for MSI 970 gaming AM3+ motherboard (AMD 970 chipset).  http://us.msi.com/product/motherboard/970-GAMING.html I am not doing any gaming, so 3D performance does not matter.

I had all my backups on an external, and somehow when I got back from my deployment, it doesn't work. I work in the IT field, so I've tried several things, but still need some help. In windows it says that the drive needs to be formatted. In Linux (parted magic) it says unallocated. I have about 300 gigs of backups just from pictures. What can I try so I can pull information off? I've tried pretty much every recovery software on Hirens Boot CD. Thanks in advance!</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=332">Hardware</category>			<dc:creator>ericrcan</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305492</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title><![CDATA[[ubuntu] Odd display poweroff issue with BenQ]]></title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305484&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2015 16:02:18 GMT</pubDate>			<description><![CDATA[So just got my new box setup (YAY)....got everything figured out but one thing...the display timeout and poweroff with the monitor.

Quad monitors had some problems but worked. Basically I'm broke and want to sell my R9 290. I have a 5450, so if I bought another 5450, do you think it would be too much of a pain in the ass to get Quad going on it? Just have never done it before and have no clue what the requirements are or how it works, and my brain is thinking it's going to be a PITA...is it a hassle?<br /><br />Edit: Also, I like using the open source drivers.</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=332">Hardware</category>			<dc:creator>lwfx</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305450</guid>		</item>	</channel></rss>
