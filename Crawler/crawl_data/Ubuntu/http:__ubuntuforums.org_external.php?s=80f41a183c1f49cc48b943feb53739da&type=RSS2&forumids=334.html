I then need a player that stops after each song so that each new song needs to be manually started. In Audacious there is an option to &quot;Stop after this song&quot;. This is basically what I need but I need the value to retain. I.e setting this in the meny only is valid for the current song and then the application reset it to normal playback. Is there some way I can set Audacious to retain this value or alternatively is there another application that will be better for me to use? Thanks!</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=334">Multimedia Software</category>			<dc:creator>Jan_Erik</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305660</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title><![CDATA[[ubuntu] Banshee crash]]></title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305518&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2015 21:45:20 GMT</pubDate>			<description>Hi, I am using Ubuntu 15.10, 64 bit, and running Banshee 2.6.2.
