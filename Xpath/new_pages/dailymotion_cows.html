Arabiya said pro-Gaddafi forces had made an invasion into the town.                       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;                       But a spokesman from the Libyan government said claims of counter-attacks were false                       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;                       Asked about reports of attacks on Marsa El Brega and Ajdabiyah, Mussa Ibrahim said: "I very much doubt it. I believe it's one of those false reports."                       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;                       Later, rebels claimed they were back in control of the eastern oil export terminal of Marsa el Brega.                       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;                       "We are probably going to call for foreign help, probably air strikes at strategic locations that will put the nail in his (Gaddafi's) coffin," Mustafa Gheriani, a spokesman for the rebel February 17th Coalition, said.                       &lt;/p&gt;                     </p></div>
