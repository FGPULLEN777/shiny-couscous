    <p>Hulu is committed to making its content available worldwide.  To do so,
    we must work through a number of legal and business issues, including
    obtaining international streaming rights. Know that we are working to make
    this happen and will continue to do so.  Given the international background
    of the Hulu team, we have both a professional and personal interest in
    bringing Hulu to a global audience.</p>

    <p>If you'd like, please leave us your email address and the region in
    which you live, and we will email you when our videos are available in your
    area.</p>
